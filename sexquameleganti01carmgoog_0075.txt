former war you were inclined towards peace, so now Your
Highness would be prepared to accede to a common and
mutual concord, to the restoration of conquests, after the
example os the other Italian powers, and to the laying
aside ol hatreds and revengeiul feelings. We therefore,
with all the eamestness in our power, exhort Your
Excellency, who have always been accustomed to destroy
the secds os discords, that, like the other Principalities os
Italy, you should yourselsdesire to accede to this common
concord, so opportune for thwarting and ruining the
, designs ol the enemies os the Catholic saith, to lay down
your arms, and to raise the siege os F errata, that renowned
city os the Church; for the execution of which, should
Your Highness give orders, as from your singular justice
and wisdom we trust and hope will be the case, you
will consult the well-being os the Christian community,
and the quietness os all Italy, which is now in very great
peril, and will remove all suspicions os a desire sor
domination; and finally you will achieve praise and
immortal glory among all people. Moreover‚ as His
Highness writes, should there be anything to com-
plain os concerning the Duke aforesaid, besides the right
judgment os the Supreme Pontiff, in which he is little
likely to fail, we promise that we also will lend our
assistance. May Your Excellency fare well.

Given at Rome, the 16th day os December, in the year
of our Lord 1482. Under the signatures os our three
seniors in order.
