Christendom?¹ ll we should say that we have done great
thingS, we should be noted for arrogance3 modesty has
always been becoming to words, magnanimity to deeds.
Let it therefore be leit to your judgment, and that os
the whole world. What Your Beatitude can hope
lor from this man we do not see; from us certainly you
may hope something. If we have not done anything
great, still we have at times done something, and with
God’s help we hope todo more. Why should Your Beati-
tude be d'ispleased with our victory? We have convoked
no council; we have planned no schism; we have not
harassed you with war. Neither up to the present time
have we learned to attack Christians in war with an infidel
soldiery. Truly this benefit of the Church conferred upon
us, bought by our blood, we shall both defend with our
good offices, and strenuously take care that it may not seem
to be perversely applied. 1t has been resolved, with your

good pardon, Holy Father, and decreed to prosecute this
war3 foras the benediction of the most Holy Patriarch when
once conferred upon his son, either could not, or certainly
should not be torn away from him, so we cannot but
hope sor a happy issue to that war which the authority os
the Supreme and Holy Pontifs roused, impelled, and pro-
voked.
