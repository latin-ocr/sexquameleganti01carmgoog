the most wise and pious Sovereigns of Castille—considering
and ponder-ing in their rninds how afflicting to Christendorn,
how pen-uicinus to the Apostolic See, how perilous to the
Catholic Faith such disturbances must be, on account os the
schism in the Church os God, which by some was already
being effected—induced by a pinus zeal sor universa-l
concord sent to us to humbly beg for peace; when our
venerable brethren themselves, when the Roman People,
and other ecclesiastical cities, and also the other potentates
os Italy supplicated, and implored us with the most urgent
prayers to the same effectz—we have deerned it right to
comply with their highly honourable aspiration, especially
since this is in accordance with our original resolve and
naturai bias in favour os procuring and seem-ing peace. And
we have fallen upon times in which nothing is more to be
desired, nothing is more necessary than that Italy should
be at arnity within itself, should lay down its arms, restore
what has been captured hy either party, put aside han-ed
and revenge, and rest in mutual tranquillity ; is we wish to
be truly Christians, is we desire to defend and protect our
liberty, our fortunes, the worship of God, and our religion,
than which nothing ought to be more dear to us, against
that most cruel nation of Turks, which is now threatening
the destruction os Italy. Wheresore, since wc are per.
suaded that both you and your renowned Republic are not
averse to this common good, since you have at all times
loved peace, and sought to remove all causes of discord, we,
seeing that all the other States desire and ask to be united
