WE wrote some days ago, with paternal· love, to Your
Nobility the causes not less just than necessary which ’
'urged us, on behali of th'e safety ol all Italy and of the
’ Christian commonwealth, to arrangea peace, exhorting that ,
you should accept the same, and withdraw froin the
war against Ferrara, which rs our city, and that ol the -
’· Roman Church, and that you should restore the places

'you had occupied· and we treated with you about this' rn ¹
the most courteous terms, not using even one word that ,.

, ’ could offend either you'rsell or your honour. But¹ you sent ,
-' us a letter ιιι reply written by you in terms far different ’ἵ

from what we hoped that we should read, paintingthe
Ferrarese war with many lying colours, and' imputing to us
motives which never existed, and never entered into our..
mind; and this has-therefore affected us⁸ with trouble and
'the greatest· grief, for it has shoiv'n. that your mind and'
soul are averse tothat p'eace and alliance which we had Ι.

resolved to r'nake among the States os Italy, and that you·
vehemently abhor them. We had hoped indeed to be able ' ·
as osten as we might wish tojudge os you exactly as though
you, were the most obedient of our sons ς, and thus when
.' we had persuaded the other princes or potentates of Italy
to arrange ·a peace and alliance, we appeared to have so

gained all our desires, that no difficulty or trouble remained
