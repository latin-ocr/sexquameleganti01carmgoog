INTRODUCTION.

T was an agreeable announcement to bibliographess
that was made in the Times οἰ the 14th of April,
1890, that the Brifish Muscurn had acquired sor its library
an unique Caxton, namely, the “Sex quam elegantis-
simae Epistolae¹¹ that passed between Pope Sixtus IV. and
the Venetian Republic, with reference to the Duchy‘ os
Ferrara, in the year 1482v This work was first discovered
in the year 1874 in the Hecht-Heine Library at Halberstadt,
bound up in a volume of seventeenth century theological
tracts, by Dr, Kiinnecke, Archivist at Marburg, and was hy
him described in the Neucr Anzeigerfdr Bibliagmphie for
Oct, 1874. Afterwards it was described by Mr. Blades in
the second edition os his ‘¹ Biography and Typography of
William Caxton,¹¹ London, 1882. Some years ago cautious
overtures were made sor its sale, at what was thought
to be an extravagant price, to the authoritiffl of the British
Museum, and the purchase was declined. In 1890, how-
ever¹ it was offered at a considerable reduction of price
to Dr. Gamett, Keeper of the Printed Eooks, who had no
hesitation in recommending its purchase to the Trustees,
by whom it was acquired sor the National Libmry.
