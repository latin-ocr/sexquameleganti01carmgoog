besieged within his· walls, to exhort us to peace only
means to wrest victory itsels from our hands, to yield up
our dominion at the pleasure of our enemies, to the
derision os the whole world, and to rouse an ’ enemy
dwelling in the heart oi our State from madness to frenzy.
And since Your Holiness makes mention of the Turks, truly
when in that war we were¹ harassed ior twenty years, and.
¹bore upon our shoulders the entire weight of the Christian
dangers, and when wearied by the duration of the war,
and the very poweriul forces and armies of the enemy, we
sought sor aid, never did we see Italy combine to asslst us,
from a desire lor the peace os Italy. But now, so it pleases
God, we are in a worse condition than that Hercules;
while we are worn out, and encounter dangers in the
war, others enjoy peace ; now when the war is coming to an
end, those same persons rush to arms, so that, in truth, we
cannot but suspect that they have not 'come together
through a love os peace, but have combined through being
, alarmed by our victory. We do not wish to say this
of Your Holiness, who have always had ¹both the honour
of God and the peace and tranquillity os His flock'so
much at heart, that on that account you have done many
great things with incredible ardour of mind and charity,
and would do lar more and greater, were it allowed to
Your Holiness by those chiefly who now appear to counsel
, peace. Neither do we wish to say this of the most
Reverend Lords the Cardinals, whose most holy intention
and desire for the common peace of Christians is perspIcuous
