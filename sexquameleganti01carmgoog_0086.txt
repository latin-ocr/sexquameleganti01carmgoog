advising, finally praying that he should prefer peace to
war: we predicted, protested that he would pay the penalty
os his solly. For the rest that concems our course, Your
Excellencies will obtain insorrnation from our letter to
the Supreme Pontiffi from which, we think, there will be
no one os so distorted or malignant a judgment that he
ean accuse us of being in the wrong, or os having omitted
anything that becomes the most modest and temperate of
rnen.
